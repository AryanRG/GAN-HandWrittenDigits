# GAN-HandWrittenDigits
Implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network to create Hand Written Digits from existing dataset of hand written digits(MNIST).

It a jupiter notebook implementation of the above mentioned .

*Used Pytorch and torchvision instead of Tensorflow and Keras*

Introduction to GAN can be found on this website : https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/ 

The dataset I used in this model was taken from the torchvision base datasets, named MNIST, which has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
